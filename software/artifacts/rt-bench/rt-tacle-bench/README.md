# RT-TACLeBench

This page should be read from the corresponding [documentation page](https://rt-bench.gitlab.io/rt-bench/md_rt_tacle_bench__r_e_a_d_m_e.html) of RT-Bench for better fruition.

This module contains a version of [TACLe-Bench](https://github.com/tacle/tacle-bench) adapted to work with the [RT-Bench framework](https://gitlab.com/rt-bench/rt-bench).

The only benchmarks currently supported are in folders `app/`, `kernel/` and `sequential/`.
`test` and `parallel` folders have been excluded from the documentation.

### Documentation

Find the original documentation on the [TACLe-Bench original repository](https://github.com/tacle/tacle-bench/tree/master/doc) and RT-Bench documentation on the [original repository](https://rt-bench.gitlab.io/rt-bench/index.html).

### Usage

This module is registered as a submodule of RT-Bench, from which it also depends.

#### Setup

The suggested way to compile benchmarks in this module requires the user to:

- Clone RT-Bench: `git clone https://gitlab.com/rt-bench/rt-bench.git`.
- Initialize the submodule by typing, from the RT-Bench root folder `make setup-tacle`

#### Compilation

Compilation is done from the `rt-tacle-bench` folder (the module root folder).

To compile the whole suite, you can simply type:

```{.sh}
make
```

Otherwise a single benchmark can be compiled by typing `make` followed by the path to the benchmark.
For example to compile only the `ammunition` benchmark
```{.sh}
make bench/sequential/ammunition/ammunition
```

By default, it will compile for `x86` platform with `gcc` and assumes RT-Bench is the parent folder.
Append these options to the `make` command to tailor compilation to your needs

- ```CC=<compiler>``` for cross-compiling
- ```RTBENCH_PATH=<path/to/rtbench/repository>``` to specify the location of the RT-bench project/repository used
- ```CORE=CORTEX_A53``` to enable performance counters features
