# Trojan Tool Software

This directory offers a reproducible environment (`./pkgs`) and a full software stack (OS, Hypervisor, and Monitor) to test the Trojan Tool in a real environment (which we leveraged to create the 4 PoC attacks). We ensure reproducibility with Nix.

## Usage

It's as simple as running Nix:

```sh
nix-build
```

Deploy the software on the target board by running the following script:

```sh
./result-9 # This script is generated by Nix, which is why it has a strange name
```
